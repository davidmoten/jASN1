1.1.3 Aug-23-2012
----------------
- allow decoding of empty object identifiers

1.1.2 Mai-14-2012
----------------
- improved efficiency in BerVisibleString
- modified BerBitString so it can be empty when decoded

1.1.1 Feb-20-2012
----------------
- fix in BerIdentifier.decodeAndCheck(), thanks to Mr.Bostijancic from TU-Wien

1.1.0 Feb-14-2012
----------------

- the default tagging can now be changed to implicit using the
  following kind of statement: SAMPLE DEFINITIONS IMPLICIT TAGS ::=
  ...

- the character '-' is now replaced by the '_' character in the name
  of Java classes

- support for indefinit length when decoding (not for encoding), has
  to explicitely enabled using the -il option

- SEQUENCE elements of type CHOICE that have not explicit tag are now
  supported by jASN1

- CHOICEs can now have sub CHOICES without tags. Only a warning is
  printed that this could one CHOICE could be integrated into another
  for better performance
